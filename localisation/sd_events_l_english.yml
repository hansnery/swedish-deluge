 sd_sweden.1.t:1 "Gustaf V Intervention Crisis"
 sd_sweden.1.d:2 "This morning, King Gustaf V gave a speech to thousands of people from his courtyard at the Royal Palace in Stockholm. He argued that once again, [SWE.GetName] needs to increase defense spending to be able to defend itself in the event of war in Europe. It was reported that [SWE.GetLeader] was furious at the king's intervention and has threatened to resign together with the whole government.\n\nThe king, however, seems adamant on the issue and will probably appoint a conservative government in case of a general resignation. The [SWE.GetAdjective] government has stated that the king's intervention puts both the form of government and [SWE.GetName]'s neutrality in jeopardy.\n\nAdvisors to the king have suggested that he make promises to keep [SWE.GetName] out of any factions to put the mind of the more isolationists MPs at ease, while some of the more conservatives have advised the king that making such promises would leave less room for maneuver in the international arena depending on how events unfold."
 sd_sweden.1.a:2 "The king will not give up the right to communicate freely with the Swedish people."
 sd_sweden.1.b:0 "Promise to keep [SWE.GetName] out of any factions."
 sd_sweden.2.t:1 "Send [NOR.GetNameDef] an Ultimatum"
 sd_sweden.2.d:2 "If [SWE.GetName] is to ever be recognized as a Great Power again, we need to correct past mistakes. Letting Norway go in 1905 was one of them and though the late King Oscar II renounced his claim on the throne of Norway, King Gustaf V is not beholden to his ancestor's vows. We can send them an ultimatum demanding the return of some of our rightful territories or even their complete subjugation but that will surely have grave consequences for better or for worse, what we need to decide is how far we want to go."
 sd_sweden.2.a:2 "Demand Trøndelag."

 sd_sweden.4.d:2 "The memorandum we received from the [NOR.GetAdjective] embassy was cold and filled with resentment but they have agreed to our demands nonetheless. [Root.GetSwedenGainsForNorway] Though we may face some initial resistance in our new acquired territories, they will surely be fully integrated in no time."
 sd_sweden.4.a:2 "It is a great day for [SWE.GetNameDef]!"
 sd_sweden.5.t:1 "[NOR.GetNameDef] Refuses"
 sd_sweden.5.d:2 "The [NOR.GetAdjective] government has refused our demands and mobilized their troops to our borders! We now have no choice but to enforce our demands with the strengh of arms."

 sd_sweden.6.t:1 "Send [FIN.GetNameDef] an Ultimatum"
 sd_sweden.6.d:2 "Of all of our losses in the past centuries, losing Finland was by far the worst of them. Unlike Norway and the other Baltic territories, Finland was under Swedish rule since the 13th century, which is why its annexation by Russia is called 'the Great Discord' in [SWE.GetNameDef]. It is time to finally amend the Great Discord!"
 sd_sweden.6.a:2 "Demand direct rule."

 sd_sweden.9.t:2 "[FIN.GetNameDef] Refuses"
 sd_sweden.9.d:2 "Our offer to bring Finland under our protection has been refused by [FIN.GetLeader]. [SWE.GetLeader] doesn't want anything else from the [FIN.GetAdjective] government, no more talks are to be had. He has summoned his generals and the invasion plans are already being laid out. For our blood, for our honor, we pledge to retake Finland!"

 sd_news.1.d:2 "In a speech delivered at the Riksdag today, [SWE.GetLeader] announced the initiation of hostilities between [SWE.GetNameDef] and [NOR.GetName].\n\nHe claimed that after fruitless attempts at negotiation to peacefully restore the rightful claims of [SWE.GetNameDef] over Norway, the [NOR.GetAdjective] government decided to mobilize their forces to the [SWE.GetAdjective] border.\n\nCommentators have predicted a long and protracted war despite [SWE.GetName]'s numerical advantage, considering the rough terrain and harsh weather and others have speculated whether any of the Great Powers would intervene to put a quick end to the conflict. Either way, it seems this is only one of the many conflicts to come to Scandinavia."

 sd_news.2.d:2 "In an emergency session earlier today, [FIN.GetLeader] asked that [FIN.GetName]'s Riksdag declare a state of war with [SWE.GetNameDef].\n\nThe [FIN.GetAdjective] leader said that the unreasonable demands made by the [SWE.GetAdjective] government had reached a breaking point and that the latest talks were being used as a diversionary tactic by [SWE.GetNameDef] to take [FIN.GetNameDef] off guard.\n\nIn Stockholm, [SWE.GetLeader] also made a passionate speech at the Riksdag, saying that [SWE.GetNameDef] would no longer be treated as a secondary power and that [SWE.GetAdjective] territorial integrity would be fully restored. The media has already dubbed this as the 'Second Finnish War'."
